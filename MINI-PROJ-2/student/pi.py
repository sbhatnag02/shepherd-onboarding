# sends a header (CHEESE) and dictionary to the target (PO)
# any file that's listening to the target PO will receive this message.

# This is nice and simple; however, hard-coding headers as strings is really
# error prone (what if we mistype the header? it'll be sent just fine, but 
# then the receiving end might crash). That's why in the next section,
# we'll introduce an alternative syntax for creating messages to send.
